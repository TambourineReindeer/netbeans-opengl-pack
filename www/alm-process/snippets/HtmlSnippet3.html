<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><p>You can always request an observer role to keep track of the projects status and usually it will get approved in a couple of days. It would be nice though to join the dev mailing list and drop a note, who you are and what your interest in the OpenGL Pack is. If you are interested in a more active role, maybe as developer, a mail to the mailinglist is mandatory.</p><p>We are looking forward to hear from you!<br /></p>

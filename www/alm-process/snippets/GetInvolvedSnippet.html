    You can always request an observer role to keep track of the projects status
    and usually it will get approved in a couple of days.

    Feel free to checkout from 
    <a href="https://netbeans-opengl-pack.dev.java.net/source/browse/netbeans-opengl-pack/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/link/subversion'); ">subversion</a>
    and start hacking. If you want contribute patches or tell us your ideas for
    improvements. If you are interested in a more active role, maybe as developer,
    a contribution is mandatory.

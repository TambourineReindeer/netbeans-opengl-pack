				<p>This program demonstrates point parameters and their effect on point primitives. 250 points are randomly generated within a 10 by 10 by 40 region, centered at the origin. In some modes (including the default), points that are closer to the viewer will appear larger. Pressing the 'l', 'q', and 'c' keys switch the point parameters attenuation mode to linear, quadratic, or constant, respectively. Pressing the 'f' and 'b' keys move the viewer forward and backwards. In either linear or quadratic attenuation mode, the distance from the viewer to the point will change the size of the point primitive. Pressing the '+' and '-' keys will change the current point size. In this program, the point size is bounded, so it will not get less than 2.0, nor greater than GL_POINT_SIZE_MAX.</p>

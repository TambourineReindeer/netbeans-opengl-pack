				<p>This program demonstrates drawing pixels and shows the effect of glDrawPixels(), glCopyPixels(), and glPixelZoom(). Interaction: moving the mouse while pressing the mouse button will copy the image in the lower-left corner of the window to the mouse position, using the current pixel zoom factors. There is no attempt to prevent you from drawing over the original image. If you press the 'r' key, the original image and zoom factors are reset. If you press the 'z' or 'Z' keys, you change the zoom factors.</p>

				<p>This program demonstrates when to issue lighting and transformation commands to render a model with a light which is moved by a modeling transformation (rotate or translate). The light position is reset after the modeling transformation is called. The eye position does not change.<br/><br/> A sphere is drawn using a grey material characteristic. A single light source illuminates the object.<br/><br/> Interaction: pressing the left or middle mouse button alters the modeling transformation (x rotation) by 30 degrees. The scene is then redrawn with the light in a new position.</p>

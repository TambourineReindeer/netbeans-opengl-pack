				<p>This program draws shows how to use multisampling to draw anti-aliased geometric primitives. The same display list, a pinwheel of triangles and lines of varying widths, is rendered twice. Multisampling is enabled when the left side is drawn. Multisampling is disabled when the right side is drawn.<br/> Pressing the 'b' key toggles drawing of the checkerboard background. Antialiasing is sometimes easier to see when objects are rendered over a contrasting background.</p>

				<p>This program demonstrates polygon tessellation. Two tesselated objects are drawn. The first is a rectangle with a triangular hole. The second is a smooth shaded, self-intersecting star. Note the exterior rectangle is drawn with its vertices in counter-clockwise order, but its interior clockwise. Note the combineCallback is needed for the self-intersecting star. Also note that removing the TessProperty for the star will make the interior unshaded (WINDING_ODD).</p>

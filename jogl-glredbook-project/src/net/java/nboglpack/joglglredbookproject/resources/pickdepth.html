				<p>Picking is demonstrated in this program. In rendering mode, three overlapping rectangles are drawn. When the left mouse button is pressed, selection mode is entered with the picking matrix. Rectangles which are drawn under the cursor position are "picked." Pay special attention to the depth value range, which is returned.</p>

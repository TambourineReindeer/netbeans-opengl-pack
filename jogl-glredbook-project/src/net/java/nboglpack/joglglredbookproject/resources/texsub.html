				<p>This program texture maps a checkerboard image onto two rectangles. This program clamps the texture, if the texture coordinates fall outside 0.0 and 1.0. If the s key is pressed, a texture subimage is used to alter the original texture. If the r key is pressed, the original texture is restored.</p>

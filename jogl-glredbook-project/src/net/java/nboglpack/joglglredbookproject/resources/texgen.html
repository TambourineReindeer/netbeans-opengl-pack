				<p>This program draws a texture mapped teapot with automatically generated texture coordinates. The texture is rendered as stripes on the teapot. Initially, the object is drawn with texture coordinates based upon the object coordinates of the vertex and distance from the plane x = 0. Pressing the 'e' key changes the coordinate generation to eye coordinates of the vertex. Pressing the 'o' key switches it back to the object coordinates. Pressing the 's' key changes the plane to a slanted one (x + y + z = 0). Pressing the 'x' key switches it back to x = 0.</p>

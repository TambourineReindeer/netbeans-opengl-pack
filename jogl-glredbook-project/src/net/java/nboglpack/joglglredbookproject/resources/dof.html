				<p>This program demonstrates use of the accumulation buffer to create an out-of-focus depth-of-field effect. The teapots are drawn several times into the accumulation buffer. The viewing volume is jittered, except at the focal point, where the viewing volume is at the same position, each time. In this case, the gold teapot remains in focus.</p>

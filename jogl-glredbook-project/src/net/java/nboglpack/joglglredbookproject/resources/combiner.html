				<p>This program renders a variety of quads showing different effects of texture combiner functions. The first row renders an untextured polygon (so you can compare the fragment colors) and then the 2 textures. The second row shows several different combiner functions on a single texture: replace, modulate, add, add-signed, and subtract. The third row shows the interpolate combiner function on a single texture with a constant color/alpha value, varying the amount of interpolation. The fourth row uses multitexturing with two textures and different combiner functions. The fifth row are some combiner experiments: using the scaling factor and reversing the order of subtraction for a combination function.</p>

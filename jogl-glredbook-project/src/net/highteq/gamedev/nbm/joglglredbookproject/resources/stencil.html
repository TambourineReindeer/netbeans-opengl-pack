				<p>This program demonstrates use of the stencil buffer for masking nonrectangular regions. Whenever the window is redrawn, a value of 1 is drawn into a diamond-shaped region in the stencil buffer. Elsewhere in the stencil buffer, the value is 0. Then a blue sphere is drawn where the stencil value is 1, and yellow torii are drawn where the stencil value is not 1.</p>

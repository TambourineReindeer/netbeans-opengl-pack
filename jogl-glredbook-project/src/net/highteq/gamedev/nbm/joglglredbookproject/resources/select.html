				<p>This is an illustration of the selection mode and name stack, which detects whether objects which collide with a viewing volume. First, four triangles and a rectangular box representing a viewing volume are drawn (drawScene routine). The green triangle and yellow triangles appear to lie within the viewing volume, but the red triangle appears to lie outside it. Then the selection mode is entered (selectObjects routine). Drawing to the screen ceases. To see if any collisions occur, the four triangles are called. In this example, the green triangle causes one hit with the name 1, and the yellow triangles cause one hit with the name 3.</p>

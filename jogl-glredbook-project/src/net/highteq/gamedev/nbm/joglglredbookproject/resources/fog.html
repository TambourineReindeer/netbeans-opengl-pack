				<p>This program draws 5 red teapots, each at a different z distance from the eye, in different types of fog. Pressing the left mouse button chooses between 3 types of fog: exponential, exponential squared, and linear. In this program, there is a fixed density value, as well as fixed start and end values for the linear fog.</p>
